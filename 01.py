"""
    Problem:

        The function `season` should take the first three letters of the
        name of a month and print the season it is in. For this program,
        assume that Dec-Feb is winter, Mar-May is spring and so on.

        If an unknown month is entered, print "Month not recognised"

    Tests:

        >>> season("jan")
        Winter
        >>> season("feb")
        Winter
        >>> season("mar")
        Spring
        >>> season("apr")
        Spring
        >>> season("may")
        Spring
        >>> season("jun")
        Summer
        >>> season("jul")
        Summer
        >>> season("aug")
        Summer
        >>> season("sep")
        Autumn
        >>> season("oct")
        Autumn
        >>> season("nov")
        Autumn
        >>> season("dec")
        Winter
        >>> season("abc")
        Month not recognised
